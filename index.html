				<li>Considering the density of nitrogen in the Chesapeake Bay is 5mg/L of water, that an oyster filters approximately 50 gallons of water a day, that there is between 15 and 18 trillion gallons of water in the Bay, and that there are between 10 and 500 million oysters in the Bay, it would take between 1.7 and 103 years to completely clean the Bay with the current amount of oysters and its current amount of pollution and no continued rate of pollution.</li>
				<li>Considering the density of nitrogen in the Chesapeake Bay is 5mg/L of water, that an oyster filters approximately 50 gallons of water a day, that the Bay receives about 300 million pounds of pollution each year, that there is between 15 and 18 trillion gallons of water in the Bay, and that there are between 10 and 500 million oysters in the Bay, it would take between 2.9 and 10697 years to completely clean the Bay with the current amount of oysters and its current amount of pollution and its continued rate of pollution.</li>
